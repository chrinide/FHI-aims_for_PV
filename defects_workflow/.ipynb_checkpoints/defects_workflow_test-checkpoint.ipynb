    "## 1. Get yourself setup with Transformer python libraries!\n",
    "To use this setup, you just need to install the Transformer libraries, as explained [here](https://github.com/JMSkelton/Transformer) (NumPy and spglib libraries are needed) and then use the python scripts described in the next sections. Make sure you have the most up to date version of NumPy, if not, use '`sudo pip install --upgrade numpy`'. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see a progress bar during calculations, you can install the tqdm module using '`sudo pip install tqdm`', but usually calculating point defects doesn't take long enough for this to be required. \n",
    "You can also '`pip install cython`' to avoid getting a compilation error message for not having this, but we actually don't use cython functionality here so it isn't necessary to run this workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "The (benign) error message you get for not having cython installed looks like this:\n",

    "## 2. Generate a supercell from your relaxed unit cell\n",
    "- Relax the volume of your unit cell using the same functional and species defaults (e.g. 'tight') as you intend to use for your defect supercell. \n",
    "- Add the following keywords to your control.in '`relax_geometry bfgs 5.e-3`' and '`relax_unit_cell full`', but do also refer to the FHI-aims manual under 'Tag: relax_geometry'. \n",
    "- Ensure that you use calculation settings (species defaults and kgrid density) for converged total energies.\n",
    "- Add the geometry file for your relaxed unit cell to the same directory as this ipython notebook.\n",
    "- Construct a supercell from this unit cell by running the script below (click on the cell, shift+enter), where you need to add the name of the geometry file for your relaxed unit cell, the format (i.e. vasp or aims) and the dimensions of your supercell.\n",
    "- Aim for the largest and most isotropic (most similar size for all three lattice vectors) supercell that is computationally feasible. \n",
    "- You will then want to relax the geometry of this supercell, but for this do no relax the unit cell volume again, comment out this keyword in your control.in: '`#relax_unit_cell full`'. Some procedures relax the supercell volume also, but that is not the procedure adopted here.\n",
    "- Note that as you increase the size of your system when constructing a supercell, your kgrid density scales inversely. For example, if you used a 4x4x4 kgrid for the unit cell, for a 2x2x2 supercell of this unit cell you can expect the same convergence for a 2x2x2 kgrid. \n",
    "- Depending on the size of your system it may only be possible to perform the geometry relaxation at the gamma point (1x1x1 kgrid), but later you will want to perform a single calculation with a denser kgrid. For this, you also comment out the keyword '`#relax_geometry bfgs 5.e-3`', and perform a single calculation using your optimised geometry.\n",

    "## 3. Check that Transformer recognises the spacegroup of your relaxed perfect supercell\n",
    "\n",
    "This step allows you to check that spglib (libraries used by Transformer) recognises the correct space group for your input structure. Transformer recognises inequivalent defects based on the symmetry of the crystal structure, so if you have a relaxed input geometry, it is important that Transformer still picks up the correct space group for the structure. It may be necessary to adjust the tolerance after relaxing your structure until the correct space group has been identified. If the tolerance needed to recognise the correct symmetry is less than the default of this script (1.0e-5), **then this must be modified in the subsequent script when generating your defect supercells next**. As a general rule 1.0e-3 would be fairly tight, but 1.0e-2 would be a loose tolerance.\n",
    "This first script also outputs the number of inequivalent species of each kind identified by Transformer with the selected tolerance. This is useful to know for the next step since, for example, the number of unique sites of Cu would tell us how many something-on-Cu antisite defects or Cu vacancies to expect for the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the script below, you need to add to name of your supercell geometry file, the format (aims or vasp) and the spacegroup your structure should have. \n",
    "The output will check the space group against the number you enter and then print the number of each symmetry equivalent instance of each species, where the degeneracy is given in brackets. If your output is a P1 spacegroup and all sites are inequivalent then the likelihood is Transformer just hasn't recognised the symmetry, so try modifying the tolerance until the correct spacegroup is recognised, noting that 1.0e-3 would be fairly tight, but 1.0e-2 would be a loose.\n",
