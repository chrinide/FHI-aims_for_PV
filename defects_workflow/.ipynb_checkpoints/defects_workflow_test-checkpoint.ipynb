    "## 1. Get yourself setup with Transformer python libraries!\n",
    "To use this setup, you just need to install the Transformer libraries, as explained [here](https://github.com/JMSkelton/Transformer) (NumPy and spglib libraries are also needed) and then use the python scripts described in the next sections. To see a progress bar during calculations, you can install the tqdm module using `sudo pip install tqdm`, but usually calculating point defects doesn't take long enough for this to be required. However, do make sure you have the most up to date version of numpy, if not, use `sudo pip install --upgrade numpy`. You can also `pip install cython` to avoid getting a compilation error message for not having this, but we actually don't use cython functionality here so it isn't necessary to run this workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "The (benign) error message you get for not having cython installed looks like this:\n",

    "                    ^\n",

    "## 2. Generate a supercell from your relaxed unit cell\n",
    "Relax the volume of your unit cell using the same functional and species defaults (e.g. 'tight') as you intend to use for your defect supercell. Add the following keywords to your control.in '`relax_geometry bfgs 5.e-3`' and '`relax_unit_cell full`', but do also refer to the FHI-aims manual under 'Tag: relax_geometry'. Ensure that you use calculation settings (species defaults and kgrid density) for converged total energies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct a supercell from this unit cell. This can be performed using Transformer. Copy the script below into the directory with your relaxed unit cell geometry. An example usage would be: \n",
    "\n",
    "`python3 Transformer_supercell.py -i geometry.in -f aims -x 2 -y 2 -z 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "which takes 'geometry.in' as the input file, the format being for FHI-aims and here you produce a 2x2x2 simple cubic supercell of this input structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim for the largest and most isotropic (most similar size for all three lattice vectors) supercell that is computationally feasible. You will then want to relax the geometry of this supercell, but for this do no relax the unit cell volume again, comment out this keyword in your control.in: '`#relax_unit_cell full`'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that as you increase the size of your system when constructing a supercell, your kgrid density scales inversely. For example, if you used a 4x4x4 kgrid for the unit cell, for a 2x2x2 supercell of this unit cell you can expect the same convergence for a 2x2x2 kgrid. Depending on the size of your system it may only be possible to perform the geometry relaxation at the gamma point (1x1x1 kgrid), but later you will want to perform a single calculation with a denser kgrid. For this, you also comment out the keyword '`#relax_geometry bfgs 5.e-3`', and perform a single calculation using your optimised geometry.\n",

    "## 3. Check that Transformer recognises the spacegroup of your relaxed perfect supercell\n",
    "\n",
    "This step allows you to check that spglib (libraries used by Transformer) recognises the correct space group for your input structure. Transformer recognises inequivalent defects based on the symmetry of the crystal structure, so if you have a relaxed input geometry, it is important that Transformer still picks up the correct space group for the structure. It may be necessary to adjust the tolerance until the correct space group has been identified. If the tolerance needed to recognise the correct symmetry is less than the default of this script (1.0e-5), **then this must be added as a command line option when generating your defect supercells next**. As a general rule 1.0e-3 would be fairly tight, but 1.0e-2 would be a loose tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first script also outputs the number of inequivalent species of each kind identified by Transformer with the selected tolerance. This is useful to know for the next step since, for example, the number of unique sites of Cu would tell us how many something-on-Cu antisite defects or Cu vacancies to expect for the structure. An example of running the script is given below, where 'CZTS.in' is the input geometry file of the unit cell, -f specifies aims as the file format and -t is the tolerance for Transformer to recognise the symmetry of the structure.\n",
